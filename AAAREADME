How to build pydiper from the idl based diper package.


STEP 1.

     Begin in pydiper folder, e.g. ~/pydiper.

     go to folder Build/

     The raw data are all in the subfolder Ions:

     ~/pydiper/Build/Ions/atom*

     These are all individual files containing energy
     levels, bound-bound radiative and collisional
     transitions.   The labels for each level will be 
     interpreted by HAOS-DIPER, and must be of the standard
     form.  See, for example, atom.h1 or atom.o1 or atom.fe2
     for this format.   This is CRITICAL to get proper quantum
     numbers.

     These data are required to build intermediate
     zdbase files in HAOS-DIPER (IDL) in the standard
     diper zdbase subfolder (e.g. ~/diper/zdbase).

STEP 2.

     These atoms must be inserted into the HAOS-DIPER zdbase files.
     This will take a few minutes. **NOTE** this will overwrite
     all data in this folder. A backup is written to zdbase.tar
     in the parent directory.

     IDL> .run ~/pydiper/Build/idl/ions2zdbase ; writes to .dbd files in
     	       				       ; ~/diper/zdbase
     	       				       ; using inputs from atoms_latest

     NOTE: If ~/diper/zdbase/atom_bf.db* files don't exist, then do, from the
     ~/pydiper/Build/idl/ folder, 

     IDL> bf2db,/doit
     


STEP 3. 

     Export the zdbase data to ascii files to read with python.
     
     IDL> .run db2ascii

     the ascii files are will be found in      ~/pydiper/Build/temporary/


STEP 4.

     Export the ascii files in ~/pydiper/Build/temporary/ to
     ~/pydiper/dbase/

     from folder ~/pydiper/Build/python  do
     
     unix> python lvl2sql.py
     unix> python bb2sql.py
     unix> python cbb2sql.py
     unix> python bf2sql.py
