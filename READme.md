# HAOS-DIPER: HAO Spectral DIagnostic Package for Emitted Radiation

What makes (HAOS-)DIPER unique?

- It is based upon the fast, flexible database software system written by D. Lindler for IDL, and takes some advantage of this system.
- It works with quantum numbers for atomic levels, enabling it to perform tasks otherwise difficult or very tedious, including a variety of data checks, calculations
based upon the atomic numbers, and searching and manipulating data based upon these quantum numbers.
- In principle, DIPER can handle conditions from LTE to coronal-like conditions.
- There is some capability for estimating data for which no accurate parameters are
available, and for accounting for the effects of missing atomic levels.
